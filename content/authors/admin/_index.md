I am fascinated by the current posssibilities Earth Observation offers. Raised as an environmental scientist with a strong background in remote sensing and geoinformatics, my research concentrates on how to **"go from data to information"** tailored for a wide range of environmentally centered research and monitoring needs. This particularly includes the preprocessing of operational EO data archives to analysis ready data, their management in data cubes, subsequent processing via data reduction, interpolation, time series analysis, and data integration with complementary data sources, as well as data analysis based on statistics and machine learning.

I fully support open science. Thus, I am publishing all my software and methods as open source code: [FORCE]({{< ref "/code/force/index.md" >}}).

I am Assistant Professor for Geoinformatics - Spatial Data Science at Trier University, where we are focusing on Earth Observation data-centered aspects.
