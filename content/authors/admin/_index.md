I am fascinated by the current posssibilities Earth Observation offers. Raised as an environmental scientist with a strong background in remote sensing and geoinformatics, my research concentrates on how to **"go from data to information"** tailored for a wide range of environmentally centered research and monitoring needs. This particularly includes the preprocessing of operational EO data archives to analysis ready data, their management in data cubes, subsequent processing via data reduction, interpolation, time series analysis, and data integration with complementary data sources, as well as data analysis based on statistics and machine learning.

I fully support open science. Thus, I am publishing all my software and methods as open source code: [FORCE]({{< ref "/code/force/index.md" >}}).

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the [Earth Observation Lab of Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin](https://www.geographie.hu-berlin.de/en/professorships/eol) in the [MAT_STOCKS project](https://www.geographie.hu-berlin.de/en/professorships/eol/projects/matstocks/mat_stocks), where we aim at quantifying anthropogenic material stocks from S1/S2 data for various countries in the world (e.g. Germany, Japan, USA) - as well as in the [FONDA CRC](https://fonda.hu-berlin.de/), where we will focus on data analysis workflows.
